# Friday Progress Tracker

A strategic progress monitoring tool designed with an INTJ-focused efficiency model. This tool allows users to track phases, weekly objectives, and daily tasks with integrated resource management (Notes and Video Guides).

## Features
- **Hierarchical Tracking:** Manage goals across Phases, Weeks, and Days.
- **Resource Integration:** Attach multiple YouTube video guides and detailed notes to each task.
- **Visual Analytics:** Real-time progress bars and a dynamic calendar view.
- **Data Persistence:** Uses LocalStorage for data saving with Import/Export functionality.
- **Clean UI:** Dark-themed, glassmorphic design for focused work.

## How to Use
1. **Add a Phase:** Start by creating a major phase from the sidebar.
2. **Define Weeks/Days:** Drill down into the timeline.
3. **Task Detail:** Click on any task to add learning resources (YouTube links) and personal notes.
4. **Data Management:** Use the Settings menu to backup your data as a JSON file.

## Deployment
